difference between expected value and mean
Avg Vs Expected Value. 
Avg is a special scenarios of expected values while all probabilities are equal.
Avg = X = my = (SUM (x)  / n ) – sum of all values div by number of values
Expected Value = Expectation of X = Summation (n =1 to n  = z) with value * prob of that value occurring
Example – Students that Scored a Certain Value of Their Test
76, 81, 100, 92. Avg = x,y,z,a  / 4
There are 4 results – so if we wrote each down and threw it into a pot then there would be a 1 in 4 chance of pulling any one out (we need to know that p value as we plug it in momentarily.
Expected Value = E[x] = 76(1/4) + 81(1/4) + 100(1/4) + 92(1/4)
		¼ (76 + 81 + 100 + 92)
Remember that there is an equal probability of pulling out any of the 4 values – hence all equal .25 and that the answer in this scenario is Avg = Expected Value
BUT what if there isn’t equal probability?
Rolling a fair die = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 6 = 21 / 6 = 3.5
Now, imagine if not an equal die!
5,6 = 1/5 others are 3/20

Expected Value = 1(3/20) + 2(3/20) + 3(3/20) + 4(3/20) + 5(1/5) + 6(1/5)
(3/20) * (1+2+3+4)  + (1/5)*(5+6) = 3.7

Another Example – Working Different Jobs
$20/hr for 8/hrs week
$12/hr for 16/hrs week
Average = ((20 + 12) / 2)  = Avg $16 per hour * 24 hours worked in a week = $384/wk
Expected Value = (20*8)+(12*16) =  $352 per week – Weighted Average is More Useful!
Average = Expected Value if all values have a equal probability of occurring.
Expected Value = takes into account, weighted
